Added Drupal 6 compatibility. Currently the same .module file handles both Drupal 5 and 6 internally, only the .info files are different.
Minor tidy-up of text messages.

Tweaked for more correct handling of white-space.
So, can now handle substitution on a single line, e.g:
This is =en= English =es= Spanish =qq= text.

"no cache" option logic reversed - changed to "cache", i.e. defaults to
"no cache" due to caching problems reported in http://drupal.org/node/269280

Added configuration options to set "no cache" and "alternative pattern".
